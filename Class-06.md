Introduction To The DOM

1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

2. DOM is not a programming language but JavaScript does need DOM to have model or notion web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.


JavaScript Object Basics

1. JavaScript object are use to keep properties and/or methods in the same data strcuture when convenient. 
An object is a collection of properties, where each propery has a key (name) and a value.

2. An advantage of creating object literals is to help create multiple objects

3. Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values.

let loud = obj.dog; (This is an example of dot notation. You can access properties on an object by specifying the name of the object, followed by a dot (period) followed by the property name)

let loud = obj['dog']; (This is an example of Bracket notation. You can access properties on an object by specifying the name of the object followed by the property name in brackets)
